# This application works by:
- scraping Genius.com's new album release list
- Fetches their URIs from Spotify API
- Creates a SQLite (melodi.db) for storing Arist, Album, and URIs
- Uses album URI to fetch all song URIs within each album
- Creates a new table within melodi.db for all songs, URI, and popularity value
- Runs fetcher_daily.py for repeated addition of song popularity value
- Regression analysis will forecast an upper and lower bound of error
- New values which fall north of the upper bound are flagged as "put_viral"
- "put_viral" tracks undergo secondary analsis to determine popularity velocity
- Popularity velocity over (X units/day) are deemed "viral_tracks"
